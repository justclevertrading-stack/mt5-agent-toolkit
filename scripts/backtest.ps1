.SYNOPSIS
    Run an MT5 Strategy Tester backtest headlessly and return parsed results.

.DESCRIPTION
    Drives terminal64.exe through a generated .ini file, waits for it to finish,
    then parses the HTML report into structured data.

    Nine behaviours this script exists to work around. All confirmed by
    experiment on 2026-08-05, MT5 build 5836.

    0. METATRADER MUST NOT ALREADY BE RUNNING.
       Start terminal64.exe /config:... while an instance is already open and
       Windows hands the command line to that instance, which ignores it. The
       launcher returns exit code 0 within a second. No report is written and
       the tester log gains not a single line, so the failure is indistinguishable
       from a bad symbol or a missing history. This script refuses to start when
       it finds the terminal running, because the alternative is a confident
       wrong diagnosis.

    1. THE AGENT PORT IS THE MOST LIKELY THING TO BREAK.
       The local tester agent binds 127.0.0.1:3000 by default. If ANY other
       program already holds that port, the terminal connects to the stranger,
       is refused, logs one line at severity 2, and abandons the run. It still
       exits with code 0 and writes no report. Nothing says "port conflict".
       This script picks a free port and passes it as Tester/Port.

    2. THE REPORT PATH MUST BE RELATIVE.
       An absolute path such as D:\out\report.htm is accepted and silently
       ignored. A relative name resolves against the terminal DATA folder.
       This is the real cause behind the "empty report from command line"
       reports on the MQL5 forum.

    3. THE .INI MUST NOT HAVE A BOM.
       PowerShell 5.1's Set-Content -Encoding utf8 writes EF BB BF, which
       corrupts the first section header. MT5 then cannot see [Common] and
       fails with "tester not started because the account is not specified".
       This script writes UTF-8 without a BOM.

    4. THE TERMINAL MUST BE WAITED ON.
       terminal64.exe is a GUI application. Use Start-Process -Wait.
       ShutdownTerminal=1 makes it exit by itself once testing completes.

    5. BOTH THE REPORT AND THE LOGS ARE UTF-16 LE.
       Read with -Encoding Unicode.

    6. THE ACCOUNT MUST ALREADY BE LOGGED IN.
       The tester refuses to start without one, even with full local history.
       Common/Login and Common/Server pin a specific saved account, which also
       keeps automation off a live account by accident.

.PARAMETER Expert
    EA path relative to MQL5\Experts, including the .ex5 extension.
    Example: Advisors\MyEA.ex5

    7. EA INPUTS COME FROM A .SET FILE, NOT THE COMMAND LINE.
       There is no ini key for individual inputs. They go in a .set file
       under MQL5\Profiles\Tester, named by Tester/ExpertParameters. Any
       input left out of the file keeps its compiled default, so a partial
       set file is safe. Format is one name=value line per input.

    8. WITHOUT A SET FILE, THE TESTER IGNORES THE COMPILED DEFAULTS.
       MetaTrader saves the last used inputs to MQL5\Profiles\Tester\
       <ExpertName>.set after every run, and reuses that file whenever
       Tester/ExpertParameters is absent. So editing a default in the
       source, recompiling and running again reproduces the OLD numbers,
       with no warning and a freshly built .ex5 on disk. Measured on
       2026-08-05: identical binary, 8 trades with no set file and 26
       with a set file naming one unrelated input.
       This script therefore writes a set file on every run. That is
       what makes a backtest a function of the source code.

    9. THE TERMINAL OUTLIVES THE PROCESS YOU WAITED ON.
       The report is written, then MetaTrader reloads its profile, opens
       charts and initialises the EA before actually exiting. Measured:
       report at 15:42:10, "exit with code 0" at 15:43:25, 75 seconds
       later. A second backtest started inside that window hits the
       already-running check in note 0 and fails, so the error lands on
       the NEXT run rather than the one that caused it. This script waits
       for the process to disappear before returning.

.PARAMETER Symbol
    Broker symbol name. Check the suffix. Exness uses EURUSDm, not EURUSD.
    A wrong name aborts the run with "symbol ... not exist".

.PARAMETER Inputs
    Hashtable of EA inputs to override, for example @{ InpRiskPercent = 0.5 }.
    Only the named inputs change; everything else keeps its default. This is
    what makes it possible to answer "which filter is costing us trades"
    without editing and recompiling the source between runs.

.EXAMPLE
    .\scripts\backtest.ps1 -Expert "Advisors\MyEA.ex5" -Symbol EURUSDm `

Launching terminal64.exe with /config: while an instance is already open does
not start a test. Windows hands the command line to the running instance, which
ignores it, and the launcher exits with code 0. No report is written and nothing
appears in the tester log, so the failure looks like a data or symbol problem.

Close MetaTrader 5 and run this again.
